//  TwinkleFOX: Twinkling 'holiday' lights that fade in and out.
//  Colors are chosen from a palette; a few palettes are provided.
//
//  This December 2015 implementation improves on the December 2014 version
//  in several ways:
//  - smoother fading, compatible with any colors and any palettes
//  - easier control of twinkle speed and twinkle density
//  - supports an optional 'background color'
//  - takes even less RAM: zero RAM overhead per pixel
//  - illustrates a couple of interesting techniques (uh oh...)
//
//  The idea behind this (new) implementation is that there's one
//  basic, repeating pattern that each pixel follows like a waveform:
//  The brightness rises from 0..255 and then falls back down to 0.
//  The brightness at any given point in time can be determined as
//  as a function of time, for example:
//    brightness = sine( time ); // a sine wave of brightness over time
//
//  So the way this implementation works is that every pixel follows
//  the exact same wave function over time.  In this particular case,
//  I chose a sawtooth triangle wave (triwave8) rather than a sine wave,
//  but the idea is the same: brightness = triwave8( time ).  
//  
//  Of course, if all the pixels used the exact same wave form, and 
//  if they all used the exact same 'clock' for their 'time base', all
//  the pixels would brighten and dim at once -- which does not look
//  like twinkling at all.
//
//  So to achieve random-looking twinkling, each pixel is given a 
//  slightly different 'clock' signal.  Some of the clocks run faster, 
//  some run slower, and each 'clock' also has a random offset from zero.
//  The net result is that the 'clocks' for all the pixels are always out 
//  of sync from each other, producing a nice random distribution
//  of twinkles.
//
//  The 'clock speed adjustment' and 'time offset' for each pixel
//  are generated randomly.  One (normal) approach to implementing that
//  would be to randomly generate the clock parameters for each pixel 
//  at startup, and store them in some arrays.  However, that consumes
//  a great deal of precious RAM, and it turns out to be totally
//  unnessary!  If the random number generate is 'seeded' with the
//  same starting value every time, it will generate the same sequence
//  of values every time.  So the clock adjustment parameters for each
//  pixel are 'stored' in a pseudo-random number generator!  The PRNG 
//  is reset, and then the first numbers out of it are the clock 
//  adjustment parameters for the first pixel, the second numbers out
//  of it are the parameters for the second pixel, and so on.
//  In this way, we can 'store' a stable sequence of thousands of
//  random clock adjustment parameters in literally two bytes of RAM.
//
//  There's a little bit of fixed-point math involved in applying the
//  clock speed adjustments, which are expressed in eighths.  Each pixel's
//  clock speed ranges from 8/8ths of the system clock (i.e. 1x) to
//  23/8ths of the system clock (i.e. nearly 3x).
//
//  On a basic Arduino Uno or Leonardo, this code can twinkle 300+ pixels
//  smoothly at over 50 updates per seond.
